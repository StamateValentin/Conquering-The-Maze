### About  

The app was made using [Processing](https://processing.org).

The app is using 2 main algorithms  :
* [Depth-First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm)
* [A*](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-search-algorithm/)

Initially, the app generates a maze. After the maze is complete it starts to find the path between up-left and down-right coners .

### How to Hack?

For a faster, or slower running just modify the `frameRate(int)` and to modify the screen size find `size(int, int)`.  
To modify the color scheme and the path appearence just find `show(r, g, b)` ( good luck with that ;) ) . Jk, I will put comments everywhere is necessary.  
More than that, you can do everything with the code( even burn it ), the comments and functions name will help you to understand the code even if it's a mess.

### Whats New?
* Binding the *Maze Generation* and *A\* Algorithm*
